# Hakner

Hakner is a collection of hobby projects for me to improve at software development. The goal as of right now is just to develop multiple projects that each serve a certain function, and for them all to be easily swapabble between (For example switching renderers without any user code changes). All of the projects should be standalone, written using the same style, fully commented and functional, and most of all easy to use.
